## Description
Alumina is a hobbyist programming language. Alumina is an [oxidised](https://www.rust-lang.org/) inspired language and is named after the most common natural oxide of Aluminium (Al~2~O~3~)[^al2o3]. Much like the elemental inspiration this language is lightweight, abrasive, and refuses to catch fire. 

This project was inspired by Hydrogen language.[^hydro]

## Building
Requires `nasm` and `ld` on a Linux operating system. Use `cargo build --release` from the project root to build the compiler. To run the compiler use either:
- `alumina-compiler [file]` 
- `cargo run --release -- [file]` 

Build artifacts can be found in the `/build` directory
